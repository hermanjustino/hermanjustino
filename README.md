# Herman Justino

Data science master’s student building production-grade cloud and analytics systems on Google Cloud.

## What I work on

- Cloud-native architectures on GCP (Firestore, BigQuery, Cloud Run, IaC)
- Analytics pipelines (OLTP → OLAP, pre-aggregations, API-served metrics)
- Full-stack applications (React, Next.js, Vite, serverless backends)
- Applied ML and data products with a focus on real-world constraints


I’m especially interested insimplifying over-engineered systems and using cloud resources intentionally.

## Background

- Full-stack developer with a strong backend and cloud focus  
- Startup founder using Google Cloud as a primary platform  

## Current focus

Right now I’m building:
