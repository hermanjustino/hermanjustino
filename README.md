# Herman Justino

I’m a master’s student in data science working at the intersection of cloud architecture, analytics, and full-stack systems. I build production-grade projects to understand how real infrastructure behaves, breaks, and scales.

I currently run a startup through the Google for Startups Cloud program, where I use GCP as my primary platform for experimenting with data pipelines, analytics systems, and application architecture. Most of my work is about turning messy, transactional data into systems that are reliable, observable, and easy to reason about.

## What I work on

- Cloud-native architectures on Google Cloud (Firestore, BigQuery, Cloud Run, IaC)
- Analytics pipelines (OLTP → OLAP, pre-aggregations, API-served metrics)
- Full-stack applications (React, Next.js, Vite, serverless backends)
- Applied ML and data products with a focus on real-world constraints
- Architecture documentation, postmortems, and decision records

## How I work

I build in public and treat projects as long-lived systems, not demos. Each repo is an experiment in architectural taste: clear boundaries, minimal services, and decisions that can be defended later.

I’m especially interested in:
- simplifying over-engineered systems
- designing for failure early
- making analytics boring and reliable
- using cloud resources intentionally, not reflexively

## Background

- Master’s student in Data Science  
- Full-stack developer with a strong backend and cloud focus  
- Startup founder using Google Cloud as a primary platform  

## Current focus

Right now I’m building:
- cloud analytics reference architectures
- a grants intelligence platform for nonprofits
- internal tools that turn data into usable signals instead of dashboards that lie
